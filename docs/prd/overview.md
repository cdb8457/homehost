# HomeHost Product Requirements Document (PRD) Overview

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create the world's most user-friendly game hosting platform that serves both casual hosts and professional community builders
- Establish HomeHost as the unified platform for multi-game community hosting with integrated social features
- Build a thriving plugin ecosystem that generates revenue for developers, communities, and the platform
- Enable gaming communities to become sustainable revenue-generating entities rather than cost centers
- Transform game server discovery from IP-based to community-driven social experiences
- Capture 10% market share of home-hosted gaming servers within 3 years through superior user experience

### Background Context

The gaming hosting landscape is fundamentally broken. Current solutions force users to choose between simplicity (paid hosting services) or control (complex technical tools like WindowsGSM). Multi-game communities must juggle separate platforms for hosting, mods, player management, and monetization - creating friction that prevents community growth and burns out administrators.

HomeHost solves this by creating the first unified platform that combines Netflix-like simplicity for casual users with enterprise-grade tools for community builders. Our three-pillar approach - Universal Game Intelligence, Community-Driven Hosting, and Monetization-Ready Infrastructure - creates network effects that make switching to competitors increasingly difficult as the platform grows.

The timing is perfect: the gaming market is shifting toward creator economies and Web3 monetization, while home hardware capabilities now rival commercial hosting infrastructure. HomeHost positions to capture this transition by making home hosting profitable instead of expensive.
