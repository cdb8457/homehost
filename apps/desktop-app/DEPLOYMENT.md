## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### **1. Complete Setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the desktop app directory
cd "/mnt/c/NewProject Fresh/apps/desktop-app"

# Install all dependencies (may take 5-10 minutes)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run start
```

### **2. First Launch Setup**

1. **Configure Steam** (Settings → Steam Configuration)
   - Download SteamCMD from [Valve's website](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)
   - Extract to `C:\SteamCMD` (or preferred location)
   - Set SteamCMD path in HomeHost settings
   - Set default installation directory (e.g., `C:\GameServers`)

2. **Deploy First Server** (Game Library)
   - Select a game (recommended: Valheim for testing)
   - Click "Deploy Server"
   - Configure server settings (name, port, players, password)
   - Choose installation directory
   - Click "Deploy Server"

3. **Monitor Performance** (Dashboard)
   - View real-time system metrics
   - Monitor server status and player counts
   - Check system recommendations for additional servers

### **3. Production Build**

```bash
# Build for Windows (creates installer)
npm run dist:win

# Cross-platform build
npm run build && npm run build-app

# Output location: ./dist/
```

### **4. Advanced Configuration**

#### **Cloud Sync Setup**
1. Get API key from HomeHost Cloud dashboard
2. Enable cloud sync in Settings
3. Enter API key and test connection
4. Servers will automatically sync across devices

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**npm install fails**
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**SteamCMD not found**
- Verify path in Settings → Steam Configuration
- Ensure steamcmd.exe exists and is executable
- Run steamcmd.exe manually once to complete initial setup

**Servers won't start**
- Check game installation in specified directory
- Verify port availability (Windows Firewall)
- Review server logs in Server Manager

**High CPU/Memory usage**
- Adjust monitoring intervals in Settings
- Reduce number of concurrent servers
- Check for background processes

### **Development Mode**
```bash
# Start with detailed logging
npm run electron -- --enable-logging

# Debug React components
npm run start:renderer
# Then in another terminal:
npm run start:main
```
