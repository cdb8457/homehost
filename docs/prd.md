# HomeHost Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create the world's most user-friendly game hosting platform that serves both casual hosts and professional community builders
- Establish HomeHost as the unified platform for multi-game community hosting with integrated social features
- Build a thriving plugin ecosystem that generates revenue for developers, communities, and the platform
- Enable gaming communities to become sustainable revenue-generating entities rather than cost centers
- Transform game server discovery from IP-based to community-driven social experiences
- Capture 10% market share of home-hosted gaming servers within 3 years through superior user experience

### Background Context

The gaming hosting landscape is fundamentally broken. Current solutions force users to choose between simplicity (paid hosting services) or control (complex technical tools like WindowsGSM). Multi-game communities must juggle separate platforms for hosting, mods, player management, and monetization - creating friction that prevents community growth and burns out administrators.

HomeHost solves this by creating the first unified platform that combines Netflix-like simplicity for casual users with enterprise-grade tools for community builders. Our three-pillar approach - Universal Game Intelligence, Community-Driven Hosting, and Monetization-Ready Infrastructure - creates network effects that make switching to competitors increasingly difficult as the platform grows.

The timing is perfect: the gaming market is shifting toward creator economies and Web3 monetization, while home hardware capabilities now rival commercial hosting infrastructure. HomeHost positions to capture this transition by making home hosting profitable instead of expensive.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

HomeHost's interface embodies "complexity made simple" - presenting a Netflix-like browsing experience for casual users while providing enterprise-grade tools for power users. The design philosophy centers on progressive disclosure: Alex sees simple, friendly interfaces that guide him to success, while Sam accesses advanced features through clear navigation without overwhelming the primary experience.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**One-Click Magic**: Primary actions (deploy server, install plugin, invite player) require single clicks with smart defaults and background automation. Users should feel like they're using consumer apps, not enterprise software.

**Community-First Design**: All interfaces prioritize community discovery and social features over technical server management. Players find servers through community profiles, not IP addresses.

**Progressive Power**: Advanced features remain accessible but don't clutter primary workflows. Sam can access detailed analytics and configuration options through clearly marked "Advanced" sections.

**Mobile-First Management**: Critical management functions work seamlessly on mobile devices, enabling admins to manage communities from anywhere.

### Core Screens and Views

**Game Library Dashboard**: Netflix-style grid showing supported games with one-click deployment buttons, community server counts, and "trending" indicators based on recent deployments.

**Community Profile Pages**: Public-facing pages showcasing community servers, member statistics, recent activity, and prominent "Join Community" calls-to-action that feel like social media profiles.

**Server Management Console**: Clean, modern interface showing server status, player lists, performance metrics, and quick action buttons for common admin tasks.

**Plugin Marketplace**: App store-style interface with featured plugins, category browsing, user reviews, and one-click installation with automatic compatibility checking.

**Analytics Dashboard**: Community growth metrics, player engagement data, and revenue tracking presented through clear visualizations that highlight actionable insights.

**Mobile Command Center**: Streamlined mobile interface focusing on critical functions: server status, player management, community chat, and emergency controls.

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards ensuring the platform serves users with disabilities. Particular attention to screen reader compatibility for community management functions and keyboard navigation for all critical workflows.

### Branding

Modern, gaming-focused aesthetic that feels premium but approachable. Color scheme balances professional credibility (for community builders) with gaming culture appeal (for players). Design system supports both light and dark modes with clear visual hierarchy.

### Target Device and Platforms

Primary: Web responsive design supporting Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems.

Secondary: Mobile web optimization for iOS and Android devices focusing on management and monitoring functions.

Future: Native mobile apps for enhanced push notifications and offline functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Unified development across server management backend, web dashboard frontend, mobile interfaces, and plugin SDK using modern monorepo tooling for coordinated releases and shared code libraries.

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Cloud-Local Architecture**: Core server management runs locally on user hardware for performance and control, while community features, plugin marketplace, and social systems operate on cloud infrastructure for scale and reliability. Local agents communicate securely with cloud services for cross-server functionality.

### Testing requirements

**Comprehensive Multi-Layer Testing**: Unit testing for all business logic (90% coverage target), integration testing for plugin sandbox security, end-to-end testing for critical user workflows, and automated compatibility testing across supported games and hardware configurations. Manual testing protocols for community features and cross-platform compatibility.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Plugin Security Architecture**: Sandboxed execution environment using containerization technology to isolate plugins and prevent security vulnerabilities or resource conflicts.

**Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket-based architecture for live server monitoring, community chat, and instant notifications across web and mobile interfaces.

**Database Strategy**: Hybrid approach with local SQLite for server-specific data and cloud PostgreSQL for community, user, and marketplace data with secure synchronization protocols.

**Authentication System**: OAuth 2.0 integration with Steam, Discord, and Epic Games for seamless user onboarding while maintaining privacy and security standards.

**API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for all platform functions enabling third-party integrations and future expansion into mobile apps and external tools.

**Scalable Infrastructure**: Cloud architecture designed to handle viral growth scenarios with auto-scaling capabilities for community features and plugin marketplace demand spikes.

**Monitoring and Analytics**: Comprehensive telemetry system tracking user behavior, system performance, and business metrics while respecting privacy and providing value through insights.
