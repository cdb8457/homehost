# Epic 1: Foundation & Game Intelligence

Create the foundational infrastructure that enables HomeHost's "Universal Game Intelligence" - the Netflix-like game library experience with one-click deployment, Steam integration, and custom game support that makes hosting magical for both Alex and Sam.

## Story 1.1 Core Platform Setup

As a developer,
I want to establish the foundational project infrastructure,
so that the team can build HomeHost efficiently with proper tooling and architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo structure is created with clear separation for backend services, frontend dashboard, and plugin SDK
2. Development environment includes automated testing, linting, and build processes
3. CI/CD pipeline is configured for automated testing and deployment
4. Database architecture supports both local server data and cloud community features
5. Basic authentication system is implemented with Steam OAuth integration
6. Health check endpoints are available for all core services
7. Documentation structure is established for developers and end users

## Story 1.2 Game Library Infrastructure

As a user,
I want to browse and deploy game servers through an intuitive visual interface,
so that I can start hosting games without technical complexity.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Game library displays supported games (Valheim, MotorTown, CS:GO 2, Rust, 7 Days to Die) in Netflix-style grid layout
2. Each game shows community server counts, recent activity indicators, and deployment difficulty ratings
3. One-click deployment button initiates server creation with progress tracking
4. Game metadata includes system requirements, player limits, and feature compatibility
5. Search and filtering capabilities allow users to find games by genre, complexity, or community size
6. Mobile-responsive design ensures full functionality on tablet and phone devices

## Story 1.3 Steam Integration System

As a user,
I want to automatically discover and deploy Steam-based dedicated servers,
so that I can host any Steam game without manual configuration.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Steam ID input field validates and fetches game metadata using Steam Web API
2. SteamCMD integration automatically downloads and configures dedicated server files
3. System detects supported dedicated server games and provides compatibility warnings
4. Automatic updates keep server files synchronized with Steam releases
5. Steam Workshop integration enables mod browsing and installation
6. Authentication with Steam credentials enables server verification and player authentication

## Story 1.4 Custom Game Support

As an advanced user,
I want to add unsupported games by uploading server executables,
so that I can host any game with dedicated server capability.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. File upload interface accepts .exe files with validation for executable format
2. Configuration wizard guides users through port settings, launch parameters, and file structure
3. Template system allows users to save and share custom game configurations
4. Community-contributed game profiles enable easy setup for unsupported games
5. Automatic detection identifies common server patterns (Minecraft, Unity, Unreal Engine)
6. Manual override options provide full control for expert users

## Story 1.5 Auto-Optimization Engine

As a user,
I want my servers to automatically configure optimal settings based on my hardware,
so that I get the best performance without technical expertise.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Hardware detection analyzes CPU, RAM, and network capabilities
2. Performance profiling recommends optimal player counts and quality settings
3. Dynamic resource allocation adjusts server parameters based on actual usage
4. Warning system alerts users when hardware limitations may impact performance
5. Performance monitoring tracks resource usage with automated optimization suggestions
6. Rollback capability restores previous settings if optimization causes issues
