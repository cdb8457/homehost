## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

HomeHost's interface embodies "complexity made simple" - presenting a Netflix-like browsing experience for casual users while providing enterprise-grade tools for power users. The design philosophy centers on progressive disclosure: Alex sees simple, friendly interfaces that guide him to success, while Sam accesses advanced features through clear navigation without overwhelming the primary experience.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**One-Click Magic**: Primary actions (deploy server, install plugin, invite player) require single clicks with smart defaults and background automation. Users should feel like they're using consumer apps, not enterprise software.

**Community-First Design**: All interfaces prioritize community discovery and social features over technical server management. Players find servers through community profiles, not IP addresses.

**Progressive Power**: Advanced features remain accessible but don't clutter primary workflows. Sam can access detailed analytics and configuration options through clearly marked "Advanced" sections.

**Mobile-First Management**: Critical management functions work seamlessly on mobile devices, enabling admins to manage communities from anywhere.

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards ensuring the platform serves users with disabilities. Particular attention to screen reader compatibility for community management functions and keyboard navigation for all critical workflows.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Unified development across server management backend, web dashboard frontend, mobile interfaces, and plugin SDK using modern monorepo tooling for coordinated releases and shared code libraries.

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Cloud-Local Architecture**: Core server management runs locally on user hardware for performance and control, while community features, plugin marketplace, and social systems operate on cloud infrastructure for scale and reliability. Local agents communicate securely with cloud services for cross-server functionality.

### Testing requirements

**Comprehensive Multi-Layer Testing**: Unit testing for all business logic (90% coverage target), integration testing for plugin sandbox security, end-to-end testing for critical user workflows, and automated compatibility testing across supported games and hardware configurations. Manual testing protocols for community features and cross-platform compatibility.
