## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Movement**: All animations serve functional purposes - providing feedback, guiding attention, or improving perceived performance
**Gaming-Appropriate Timing**: Slightly faster than typical web apps to match gaming user expectations
**Accessibility Consideration**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings with essential motion only

### Key Animations

- **Server Deployment Progress**: Animated progress bar with gaming-themed milestones and estimated completion
- **Community Member Count**: Smooth number transitions with subtle celebration effects for growth
- **Plugin Installation**: Progress indication with preview of plugin benefits during installation
- **Success Celebrations**: Satisfying completion animations for major accomplishments (first server, community join)
- **Status Transitions**: Smooth color and icon transitions for server health changes
- **Mobile Gestures**: Clear visual feedback for swipe actions and touch interactions

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load**: <2 seconds for dashboard on 3G connections
- **Interaction Response**: <100ms for common actions, <16ms for animations
- **Gaming Context**: Minimize impact on game performance when managing servers

### Design Strategies

**Optimized Assets**: 
- WebP images with fallbacks for maximum compatibility
- SVG icons for crisp display at all resolutions
- Lazy loading for community images and non-critical content

**Efficient Interactions**:
- Skeleton screens during data loading
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features

**Gaming Performance**:
- Background operation modes to minimize resource usage
- Performance impact warnings for resource-intensive operations
- Option to pause monitoring during active gaming sessions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create detailed wireframes** in Figma for all key screen layouts
2. **Develop interactive prototypes** for critical user flows (deployment, community joining)
3. **Design component library** with full gaming-appropriate styling
