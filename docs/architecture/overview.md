# HomeHost Fullstack Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for HomeHost, the revolutionary gaming hosting platform that combines local hardware control through a Windows application with cloud-connected community features via web dashboard. The architecture enables users to own their hosting infrastructure while participating in a thriving social gaming economy.

HomeHost's hybrid local-cloud approach creates a unique competitive advantage: users maintain complete control over their gaming servers through local Windows applications, while cloud services enable community discovery, cross-server player management, and monetization features that transform hosting from a cost center into a revenue opportunity.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

HomeHost employs a revolutionary hybrid local-cloud architecture where Windows applications serve as autonomous game server engines while cloud services provide community features, social discovery, and remote management capabilities. The Windows app handles all local server operations, Steam integration, and plugin execution, while cloud services manage community profiles, cross-server player relationships, and the plugin marketplace.

This architecture maximizes gaming performance through local processing while enabling social features and remote management through cloud connectivity. The design ensures users maintain complete control over their hardware and data while participating in a connected gaming community ecosystem.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Hybrid Windows Native + Cloud Services Architecture
**Core Services:** 
- Windows WPF/WinUI application for local server management
- Azure cloud services for community features and web dashboard
- Real-time sync between local and cloud components
- Secure plugin execution environment

**Deployment Host and Regions:** 
- Windows applications deployed locally on user hardware
- Cloud services hosted on Azure with global CDN distribution
- Regional deployment for optimal latency (US East/West, EU West, Asia Pacific)

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with clear separation between Windows app and cloud services
**Monorepo Tool:** Nx workspace for unified build and dependency management
**Package Organization:** Platform-specific packages with shared TypeScript libraries

### Architectural Patterns

- **Hybrid Local-Cloud:** Local Windows app for performance-critical operations, cloud services for social features and remote access
- **Event-Driven Sync:** Real-time synchronization between local installations and cloud services using SignalR and message queues
- **Plugin Architecture:** Secure sandboxed plugin execution with containerization for isolation and security
- **API Gateway Pattern:** Centralized authentication, rate limiting, and routing for all cloud service interactions
- **CQRS for Community Data:** Separate read/write models for optimal performance in community and player management operations
